[Flagbase](https://flagbase.com) is an open source feature management platform, engineered with scalability and performance in mind. Flagbase is a base for all your feature flags (i.e. "flag" + "base"). It's essentially a remote configuration service that streams feature flags to your applications.

## Status
Flagbase is **NOT production** ready.

We're still in the process of building the MVP. You can join us on [slack](https://flagbase.slack.com) in the [#oss-team](https://flagbase.slack.com/archives/C01A58GCR9Q) channel.

## Features

Aside from the usual features a remote configuration service provides, Flagbase offers these additional features + many more!
* Multiple transports (HTTP long-polling, SSE, gRPC)
* Minimalist/composable targeting rules
* Percentage rollouts + configurable consistent hashing mechanism
* Access management (RBAC via [casbin](https://casbin.org/))
* Extendable ~ e.g. integrate to use your own user attribution platform(s)
* Can be provisioned to the cloud of your choice or run on-prem

## Getting started
Flagbase is very easy to get up and running. Follow these steps to get started:
1. [Set up the core](https://flagbase.com/docs/core/setup): provision the service on server(s). You can use your preferred cloud vendor.
1. [Integrate to your application](https://flagbase.com/docs/sdk/overview): use the SDK in your application to wrap features you want to control remotely.
1. [Configure targeting](https://flagbase.com/docs/guides/targeting): set up your flag's targeting rules so users see feature variations intended for them.

That's it! Now your ready to release your feature code - knowing that you'll be able to turn it off anytime ðŸš€

## Directories
This [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) contains the code for Flagbase Core, UI & SDKs.
* **[`/core`](./core/README.md)**: The primary resource provider. This microservice consists of the key services used to manage protected resources and stream flagsets to the SDKs.
* **[`/sdk`](./sdk/README.md)**: SDKs retrieve and evaluate flagsets from the Core.
* **[`/ui`](./ui/README.md)**: UI interacts with the [Core API](https://flagbase.com/docs/api). It is used to manage resources (e.g. workspaces, projects, environments, flags etc).
