Targeting is a spec used to determine a flag's variaation. This spec consists of a set of rules which when evaluated using a user's context (i.e. traits), determines which variation of a flag that particular user will recieve. So essentially you could say targeting rules are conditions mapped to a variation. A flag's targeting rules are scoped to a particular project environment.
